Today I would like to discuss the job recruitment issues and how to face them with dignity.

When you apply for jobs on LinkedIn or other job boards, you usually get a lot of *recruitment SPAM*.
It's better to focus time and energy on something more meaningful than having pointless and exhausting interviews that yield little to no results, or worse, they land you a bad job on a failing project.

# How do I survive this?

Either don't work with recruitment agencies but with the client itself or ask them meaningful questions in regard to the job.

# Sample (meaningful) questions

* What are the expectations towards me?
* What is the management style on that team?
* What's the job experience of the team manager?
* Are the team members diverse? Are they comfortable with having a foreigner on the team?
* Are there multiple teams working on one product? What's your plan to deal with the coordination issues?
* Is it a lead position? Will I be able to hire my own team members?
* Is it a fully remote position or do you expect me to relocate after a while?

# What if they answer?

If they do, look for meaningful answers. A lying / bad manager will usually not put any effort into making you comfortable or getting to know you better, so you will save yourself a lot of time by eliminating such people out of the job search process -- they usually drop the contact or use the *YES/NO* answers.
