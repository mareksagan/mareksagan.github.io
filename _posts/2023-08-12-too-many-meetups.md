Let's talk about Meetup.com and the way they handle online meetings and how you can be more efficient while networking on that platform.

# What is a Meetup?

It's a socializing event taking place on Meetup.com, a platform that hosts many different communities and both offline and online events, from developer conferences to sports or pro bono therapy sessions. You may also do language exchange there or just network / meet new people. 

# Why do I need this?

It's important to know the newest things happening in your industry or to refresh your language skills and if you can do it for free, why not?

# Going to meetings is complicated and my calendar is a mess, what do I do?

Just sing up for the events you like and download the corresponding ICS files. Merge them here and import them to your calendar in bulk: https://icsmerger.com/
