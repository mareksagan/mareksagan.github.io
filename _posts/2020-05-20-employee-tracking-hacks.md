Today I would like to discuss the ATS systems and the way they work.

When you apply to jobs on LinkedIn or any other job boards, your application doesn't actually go to the recruiter or HR themselves, but to the Application Tracking System.

# What is ATS?

It's meant to reduce the effort of selecting the right candidates from thousandes of applicants. Based on keywords.

# How do I survive this?

Ever saw a resume full of text that was unreadable? It was actually SEO optimized.

You can check the optimization [here](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-examples-keywords-for-software-engineers/) and increase your score thanks to that nice tool.
