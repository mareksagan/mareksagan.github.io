Today I would like to discuss the employee tracking tools and the way they work.

When you start working, your manager usually asks you to install Skype for Business or some other corporate IM tool. Thanks to the **Skype Manager**, an *Employee Tracking Tool*.

# What is Skype Manager?

It lets an authorized person to see how many breaks you took and to disable the status options in *Skype for Business / Lync / Microsoft Teams*.

# How do I survive this?

Ever had a *1-on-1* with your manager when you heard that you don't work enough? Or you should take less breaks? It was actually possible thanks to the *Employee Tracking Tools*.

You can check the Mouse Move [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/move-mouse/9nq4ql59xlbf?) and show your manager how dedicated you are.
