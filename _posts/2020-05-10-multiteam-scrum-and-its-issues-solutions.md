description: Scaling Scrum - best practice?

Today I would like to discuss the ATS systems and the way they work.

When you apply to jobs on LinkedIn or any other job boards, your application doesn't actually go to the recruiter or HR themselves, but to the Application Tracking System.

# What is Scrum?

It's meant to bring more flexibility and move the projects forward by modularizing work into Sprints and bringing the teammembers closer to each other by encouraging tighter cooperation.

# What happens when you add more teams to your project?

Usually misscommunication and chaos.

# How to prevent these issues from occuring?

It takes a talented and an open-minded manager to do Scrum properly and there's a general lack of them. But it also takes a better methodology to scale Scrum - Large Scale Scrum (LeSS).

# What is LeSS and how does it help with the mentioned issues?

It encourges delegation of selected people for attenting meetings instead of involving everyone in every meeting and casing you a huge headache.

# How should I tell my boss about it?

You can check out [this website](https://less.works/) and tell him about it. Also mention that the company is losing money thanks to daily meeting and coordination inefficiencies and he could get promoted to a senior manager by solving them.
