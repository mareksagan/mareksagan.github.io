description: How to learn business and marketing efficiently

Let's talk about business skills and why they are **more** important than technical skills, and how to aquire the efficiently.

# What are business skills?

Either don't work with recruitment agencies but with the client itself or ask them meaningful questions in regard to the job.

# What is the Weekend MBA?

It's a concise course based upon **The Personal MBA** reading list book summaries. The summaries chosen have been compared with the original books and are good enough to be used for knowledge transfer.

# Why do I need this?

Do you work overtime for free? Do you have an impression that your manager hates you? Did you ever experience racist treatment at work and didn't know how to act on it?

By becoming excellent at business, you will be able to find better (contract) jobs and avoid such situations altogether.

# I work overtime (or not) and I don't have time to learn, what do I do?
